Project: Text Adventure Demo
Purpose: Game was created to test my ability to create a basic text-based game
  that allowed traversal through different rooms, implemented a save system
  where room states remained persistent on game load, and design a a basic
  turn-based combat system. 

What's left?
  Implement more rooms, give prompts on available options in a given room.
  Possibly create a room that creates randomly generated enemies with different
  stats and weaknesses. (Might be done in a different project, possibly something
  in Unity/Graphical based).

Usage:  python [every .py file except Start.py]
        python Start.py
